If data is available that is not directly relevant to the procedure tested, this will be categorized as “None.” In these cases, a vendor may receive a categorization of “None” with additional notes and screenshots about that data.</p>

        <p>Minimally processed data collected by the capability showing that event(s) occurred specific to the behavior under test. (i.e. showing the procedure/command that was executed). Evidence must show definitively that behavior occurred and be related to the execution mechanism (did happen vs may have happened). Evidence must be related to what caused the behavior. There is no evidence of complex logic or an advanced rule leading to the data output, and no labeling occurred other than simple field labeling.</p>

        <p>Data is presented from a managed security service provider (MSSP) or monitoring service based on human analysis and indication of an incident occurring. MSSP are inherently delayed due to the manual analysis necessary and will be marked as delayed to remain consistent with other delayed detections.</p>
